# /improve-system

Keep your system sharp. One skill, four modes. Detect the right mode from conversation context, or ask.

## Modes

| Mode | Trigger | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Setup Review** | Default for new users, "review my setup", "how's my setup". | Full audit of your Claude Code environment with prioritized action items. |
| **Experience Capture** | "capture this", "log this", user describes a win/lesson. | Quick structured entry written to knowledge folder. |
| **Session Review** | "recap my week", "what did I do", bare invocation for returning users. | Weekly recap from session history and git log. |
| **Audit** | "audit", "health check", "what's stale". | Check for stale rules, unused servers, dead skills, contradictions. |

If unclear, ask:

> "What are we working on? I can:
> 1. **Review your setup** (CLAUDE.md, MCP servers, skills, hooks, project structure)
> 2. **Capture an experience** (a win, lesson, or story)
> 3. **Recap your sessions** (weekly review from session history)
> 4. **Audit your system** (find stale or conflicting content)
>
> Or describe what you're thinking and I'll figure it out."

## Data Sources

Everything comes from local files. No MCP read calls.

- **Session history**: Read JSONL session files from `~/.claude/projects/*/`. Extract: projects worked on, tools used, skills invoked, timestamps, summaries, duration.
- **Setup files**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, project-level CLAUDE.md, `~/.claude/settings.json`, MCP server configs (`~/.claude/mcp_servers.json`).
- **Git history**: `git log --oneline --since="2 weeks ago"` for what was actually committed.
- **Knowledge folder**: `./knowledge/` (if exists).

## Rules

- Every finding must be backed by data from their sessions or files. Don't suggest generic improvements.
- "Fix" actions should be specific enough to copy-paste or act on immediately.
- If a fix is something you can do right now (edit CLAUDE.md, create a skill), offer to do it.
- Always include "What's Working Well" so it doesn't feel like a list of failures.
- Don't force learnings from single instances. Only flag a pattern if it recurs.
- Don't auto-run changes without approval. Show what you'll change and ask first.
- Never mention raw session counts or token totals. Use streak, relative terms ("your recent sessions"), or project names instead.
- Contradictions aren't always bad. Document when each approach applies rather than picking a winner.

## Instructions

### Step 0: Determine Mode

Read local session files from `~/.claude/projects/*/` to understand usage level.

- **< 5 local sessions (or no session data)**: Run **Onboarding** (within Setup Review).
- **5+ sessions, bare invocation**: Run **Session Review**.
- **Explicit trigger**: Run the matching mode from the table above.

---

### Mode 1: Setup Review

The core coaching mode. Full audit of their Claude Code environment.

#### Onboarding (< 5 sessions or no data)

When someone is new, don't punt them. Teach them what Claude Code can do, understand their goals, and set them up right.

**Step 1: Welcome**

> "Welcome! Looks like you're just getting started. Let me walk you through what's possible and help you set things up right from the start."

**Step 2: Understand their goal**

Ask ONE question:

> "What are you mainly using Claude Code for? Building an app, automating workflows, writing content, learning to code, something else?"

Wait for their answer. This shapes everything that follows.

**Step 3: Project structure check**

Read the folder structure, CLAUDE.md, README, and key files. Based on their stated goal + what the project contains:

If the project is new or minimal, suggest structure based on project type:
- `knowledge/` folder with relevant subfolders
- `.claude/skills/` with 1-2 starter skills matching their goal
- `projects/` folder if they'll manage multiple workstreams

If the project already has structure, acknowledge what's there and suggest gaps.

Offer to set up whatever they want right now.

**Step 4: Claude Code walkthrough**

Based on their goal, walk them through the capabilities that matter most. Keep it practical, not a feature dump.

For everyone:
- **CLAUDE.md** - The most important file. Tells Claude your preferences, tech stack, rules. Without it, Claude starts from zero every session. Check if they have one, offer to create it.
- **Plan mode** - Before big tasks, ask Claude to plan first. Catches mistakes before they happen.
- **Tools** - Briefly explain Read, Edit, Grep, Bash and when to use each.

Based on their goal:
- **Building apps**: Mention parallel sessions, agents/subagents, structuring complex tasks.
- **Automating workflows**: Mention hooks, custom skills, MCP servers.
- **Content creation**: Mention research, drafting, iteration workflows.
- **Learning**: Mention asking Claude to explain as it goes, using Plan mode for understanding.

Keep each section to 2-3 sentences max.

**Step 5: Quick config check**

Even without session data, check their config files:
- Do they have a CLAUDE.md? If not, offer to create one based on their stated goal.
- What MCP servers are configured?
- Any hooks set up?

If you can fix something right now, offer to do it. End with a clear next action, not a menu.

Skip to **End of Skill** after onboarding.

#### Standard Setup Review (5+ sessions)

**Step 1: Check for previous reviews**

If this is a return visit, mention:

> "Last time I suggested: {previous recommendations}. Want me to check how you're doing on those, or start fresh?"

For first review, ask:

> "Want a quick review or a deep dive?"
> - **Quick**: I'll check your setup, recent sessions, and give you 3 things to fix this week.
> - **Deep**: I'll read every config file, audit your full environment, and give you a prioritized action plan.

**Step 2: Quick Review**

Analyze from local session files:

- **Usage patterns**: What tools do they lean on vs. underuse? Are sessions getting shorter or longer?
- **Skill usage**: Which skills have they tried? What haven't they touched?
- **Workflow signals**: Do they use Plan mode? Agents? Hooks? Parallel sessions?
- **Recent prompts**: What are they asking Claude to do? Any repeated patterns that could be automated?
- **Project fit**: Does the project have structure that helps Claude understand context?

Output exactly 3 action items, ranked by impact:

```
## Setup Review

**Activity**: {current streak, main focus}

### What's Working Well
- {1-2 things they're doing well}

### What to Improve
1. {Most impactful action item with specific steps}
2. {Second action item}
3. {Third action item}

### Quick Win
{One thing they can do in the next 5 minutes}
```

**Step 3: Deep Dive**

Read and audit every layer. For each layer, read the relevant files and cross-reference with session history.

**Layer 1: CLAUDE.md**

Read `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global) and any project-level CLAUDE.md.

Check:
- Are there rules? If empty or missing, that's a high-priority finding.
- Do the rules match what they actually do? (Compare rules to session patterns)
- Are rules too generic? ("Write clean code" is useless)
- Are rules too long? (Best CLAUDE.md files are under 30 lines)
- Missing rules they need based on their tech stack and patterns

Analyze the gap between what they do and what their CLAUDE.md says:
- Missing rules from session patterns (e.g., writes TypeScript but no TS conventions)
- Rules to remove (generic advice, tools they don't use, duplicates)
- Rules to sharpen (vague rules that should be specific)

**Layer 2: MCP Servers**

Read `~/.claude/mcp_servers.json` (or equivalent config).

Check:
- What MCP servers are configured?
- Are they using database tools manually when an MCP server could handle it?
- MCP servers configured but never used?
- Missing MCP servers based on their workflow

**Layer 3: Skills**

Read all skills in `~/.claude/skills/`.

Check:
- How many custom skills do they have?
- Which skills have they used vs not used?
- Are there custom skills that are stale or broken?
- Could they benefit from creating skills for repeated workflows?

**Layer 4: Hooks**

Check `~/.claude/settings.json` and project-level settings for hooks.

Check:
- Are any hooks configured?
- Could they benefit from pre/post hooks?

**Layer 5: Project Structure and Knowledge**

Classify the project type:
- **Code/app** (package.json, src/, build configs)
- **Content/creative** (drafts, scripts, assets, writing)
- **Knowledge/operations** (docs, processes, playbooks, reports)

Based on project type, check for:
- `.claude/skills/` folder (repeated workflows should become skills)
- `knowledge/` or equivalent context folder
- Project-specific skills vs. generic skills
- Finished work organization (archive/done patterns)

**Layer 6: Workflow Patterns**

From session history, identify:
- Plan mode usage
- Parallel sessions
- Agents/subagents
- Session length patterns (short = tactical, long = could benefit from planning)
- Commit frequency
- Repeated prompts that could become a skill or hook

**Deep Dive Output Format:**

```
## Deep Dive Results

**Environment Score**: {X}/10
Based on recent sessions across {Y} projects.

### Critical (fix now)
1. {Finding}: {what's wrong and why it matters}
   Fix: {exact action to take}

### High Impact (do this week)
1. {Finding}: {what's wrong and why it matters}
   Fix: {exact action to take}

### Nice to Have (when you have time)
1. {Finding}
   Fix: {action}

### CLAUDE.md
**Current**: {line count} lines, {rule count} rules

Add:
1. `{exact rule text}` - You did {X} in {Y} of your recent sessions.

Remove:
1. `{quoted existing rule}` - {reason}

Sharpen:
1. Before: `{existing rule}` -> After: `{improved rule}`

### What's Working Well
- {Positive finding}
- {Positive finding}
```

Keep the total list to 10 items max. Prioritize ruthlessly. Keep CLAUDE.md under 30 lines if fixing.

**Step 4: Follow-up on previous recommendations**

If return visit and user wants to check progress:
- Compare current state against each previous recommendation
- Mark each as: done, partially done, or not started
- For items not started, re-evaluate: still relevant? Reprioritize if needed.
- Drop recommendations that no longer apply.

**Step 5: Apply on approval**

> "Want me to fix any of these now? I can update your CLAUDE.md, create missing skills, or configure MCP servers."

Work through fixes one by one, confirming each before applying.

---

### Mode 2: Experience Capture

Quick capture. No recap needed.

#### Step 1: Extract the experience

From what the user said, extract:

```markdown
# {Date} - {Brief Title}

## What happened
{1-2 paragraphs based on what they described}

## Key learning
- {The transferable insight}

## Why it matters
{One sentence on why this is worth remembering}

## Tags
{topic1, topic2, topic3}
```

#### Step 2: Write

Write to `./knowledge/experiences/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{brief-slug}.md`. Create directory if needed with `mkdir -p`.

#### Step 3: Confirm

```
## Captured

**{title}** saved to `{filename}`
```

---

### Mode 3: Session Review

Weekly recap from session history and git log.

#### Step 1: Read local session history

Read JSONL session files from `~/.claude/projects/*/`. Focus on the last 7 days. Also run `git log --oneline --since="7 days ago"` for commit context.

Extract:
- Projects worked on (group by project name)
- Activity types (coding, content, research, other)
- Tools and skills used
- Session durations and timestamps
- Summaries

#### Step 2: Weekly Recap

```
## This Week

**{streak} day streak | Focus: {main project/activity}**

### What you worked on
- {Project/activity 1}
- {Project/activity 2}

### Best session
{The most interesting or productive session this week. One sentence.}

### Add to your playbook
{1-2 specific things they should start doing based on this week's patterns.}
```

Keep the recap under 15 lines. If < 3 sessions this week: "Light week. Here's what I have:" and generate what you can.

#### Step 3: Capture additional experiences

After showing the recap, ask:

> "Anything else from this week worth capturing? A win, a lesson, something you figured out. A sentence or two is plenty, or type 'skip'."

If they share something, capture it as an experience entry. If they skip, move on.

#### Step 4: Write recap

Write the weekly recap to `./knowledge/experiences/recaps/{YYYY-MM-DD}-weekly-recap.md`. Create directories as needed with `mkdir -p`.

---

### Mode 4: Audit

Quick health check for rot.

#### Step 1: Read setup files

Read all setup files from the Data Sources section above.

#### Step 2: Run checks

- **Stale CLAUDE.md rules**: Rules about tools/patterns not seen in recent sessions
- **Unused MCP servers**: Configured but never called in session history
- **Dead custom skills**: Skills in `~/.claude/skills/` that reference missing files or broken patterns
- **Contradictions**: Rules that conflict with each other or with actual behavior
- **Orphaned knowledge**: Files in knowledge directories that nothing references

#### Step 3: Report

```
## System Audit

**Health**: {Good / Needs attention / Needs cleanup}

### Issues Found
1. {Issue} - {what's wrong and what to do}
2. {Issue} - {what's wrong and what to do}

### Clean
- {Things that checked out fine}
```

Keep to 10 items max. If everything is clean, say so and suggest Setup Review mode instead.

#### Step 4: Fix on approval

> "Want me to fix any of these?"

Apply only what they approve. Never auto-delete without explicit approval.
