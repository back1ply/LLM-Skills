## Actionable Output Commands

### Backup Commands

Before making changes, backup current configuration:

**Gemini/Antigravity:**
```bash
cp -r .agent/skills .agent/skills.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

**Claude Code:**
```bash
cp -r .claude .claude.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

**Cursor:**
```bash
cp -r .cursor/rules .cursor/rules.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### Auto-Consolidation Suggestions

When two skills have >70% capability overlap, offer a merge:

```markdown
**Merge Suggestion:** skill-a + skill-b -> skill-combined

**Shared Capabilities:**
- [capability 1]
- [capability 2]

**Unique to A:**
- [capability 3]

**Unique to B:**
- [capability 4]

**Proposed Action:** Generate merged SKILL.md draft
**Token Savings:** ~500 (30% reduction)
```

### Removal Commands

Provide exact commands for each removal:

```bash
# Remove skill: [skill-name]
rm -rf .agent/skills/[skill-name]

# Or for single-file skills:
rm .cursor/rules/[rule-name].md
```

### Installation Commands

**Gemini (via MCP skill-loader):**
```text
Use mcp_agent-skill-loader_install_skill with skill_name: "[skill-name]"
```

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude plugins add [plugin-name]
```

**Manual:**
```bash
mkdir -p .agent/skills/[skill-name]
# Then create SKILL.md with appropriate content
```

### Verification Steps

After changes:

```text
1. List skills to confirm changes took effect
2. Test a sample prompt that would trigger the skill
3. Verify no errors in AI assistant startup
4. Confirm token reduction in context usage (if measurable)
```
