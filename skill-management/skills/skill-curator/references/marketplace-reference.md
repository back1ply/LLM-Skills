## No Official Alternative (Keep External)

These capabilities have **no official equivalent** — external plugins are acceptable:

- Advanced Python frameworks (Django/FastAPI agents)
- Data engineering patterns (Spark, dbt, Airflow)
- Comprehensive UI/UX design databases
- Business analytics / KPI dashboards
- Domain-specific skills (DAX, Power BI, etc.)

## Marketplace Identification

### How to Identify Plugin Source

Parse the plugin identifier format: `plugin-name@marketplace-name`

```text
pr-review-toolkit@claude-plugins-official  -> Official (Anthropic-made)
superpowers@claude-plugins-official        -> Endorsed (third-party, in official)
python-dev@some-other-marketplace          -> External (third-party marketplace)
my-skill@my-repo                           -> Custom (user's own)
```

### Identifying Official vs Endorsed

- **Official:** `author.name` = "Anthropic" AND `author.email` = "support@anthropic.com"
- **Endorsed:** Listed in marketplace but author is NOT Anthropic

### Overlap Resolution by Source

When two plugins have overlapping capabilities:

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Official vs External (same capability) | **Remove external**, keep official |
| Endorsed vs External (same capability) | **Remove external**, keep endorsed |
| Official vs Endorsed (same capability) | Keep official (unless endorsed is clearly superior) |
| External vs Custom (same capability) | User choice (ask or keep custom) |
